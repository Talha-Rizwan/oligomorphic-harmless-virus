# oligomorphic-harmless-virus
Introduction::
This is a program that gives a basic demonstration of how an oligomorphic virus works. These viruses change there decryptors in new generations.
	Procedure:
    1. The program starts by generating a key from a module of cryptography library i-e Fernet and store the key in a file. 
    2. The program then asks user whether to encrypt the helloWorld.py file
    3. This encryption is done using the generated key.
    4. Then the file is decrypted using the decryption key after the userâ€™s approval.
    5. The next time a new key will be generated and the whole process will be repeated.
